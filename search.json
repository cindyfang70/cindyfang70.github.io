    "text": "The Biostatistics PhD program at Johns Hopkins has several major requirements throughout the five-year degree. In the first year, students are required to take coursework and write the comprehensive exam at the end of the four terms. In the third year, students take the preliminary oral exam to advance to candidacy. Finally, in the fifth year, students defend their theses. This blog post is about the preliminary oral exam.\n\nWhat is the preliminary oral exam?\nThe preliminary oral exam is taken by PhD students at some point during their third year of study and upon passing the exam, students obtain the status of PhD candidate. To take the exam, students must first begin by forming a committee of five professors in total. There are strict requirements for the composition of the committee that I won’t go into detail about here. The exam itself is roughly 2 hours long, consisting of a 15-20 minutes long presentation from the student on their current research, followed by 60-90 minutes of questions from the committee members. After the questioning period, the student leaves the room and the committee members discuss the student’s performance. The committee then votes on whether the student has passed the exam. The guidelines for the exam are as follows:\n“The purpose of this [preliminary] examination is to determine whether the student has both the ability and knowledge to undertake significant research in his/her general area of interest. Specifically, the examiners will be concerned with the student’s: (1) capacity for logical thinking; (2) breadth of knowledge in relevant areas; and (3) ability to develop and conduct research leading to a completed thesis.”\n\n\nScheduling\nOne of the most annoying aspects of this exam is actually the scheduling. Unsurprisingly, it is difficult for five busy academics to find a common 2 hour block of time to meet. Our department’s academic adminstrator was able to handle all the scheduling for me. I simply had to provide her with a list of the committee members’ names and contact information, as well as a rough date for when I wanted to take my oral exam.\nI initially tried to schedule my exam for the end of December, so that I could (hopefully) relax and celebrate over the winter holidays. However, there was not a single 2 hour block of time in December when my committee members were all free. Instead, I pushed the date back to the middle of January, and ended up scheduling for January 10th, before the start of classes in the School of Public Heatlh.\nThe most obvious downside to scheduling an exam for immediately after the winter holidays is that you will likely spend your holidays working. This ended up being the case for me, although I worked at a much more relaxed pace than usual. One upside to studying through the holidays is that your collaborators will be on break, which means you have fewer responsibilities and distractions from your studies. Another perk is that picking a date before the start of classes made scheduling much easier, since most professors won’t have any teaching during this time. I can’t say whether or not I recommend this strategy because it will depend highly on your preferred working style and family obligations during the holidays.\n\n\nStudying for the exam\nI started studying in earnest for my oral exam a little more than a month in advance. At this point, I put my research on hold and instead focused on reviewing important concepts and literature in genomics. I created a document with a list of different topics that I thought I might get asked about. I also kept track of questions that came up while reading papers or discussing my research with classmates, and made sure to ask my advisor these questions during our weekly meeting. This was probably one of the most useful things I did to prepare, as my advisor agreed to meet with me for an extra 30 minutes every week and I found these discussions to be extremely productive.\nI also reviewed the coursework from my first year in the program, with a focus on concepts from the Advanced Methods sequences such as GLMs. I use GLMs in my research so I thought this would be low-hanging fruit for committee members to ask about, and it did indeed come up during my exam. I probably spent a bit too much time on re-deriving equations but I found that this gave me some much-needed confidence.\nSince my research involves using non-negative matrix factorization, I felt it was necessary to review some linear algebra results. I reviewed some definitions, the rank-nullity theorem, and the spectral theorem. I even practiced writing some basic proofs just to make sure I understood what I was doing. Unsurprisingly, none of this stuff actually showed up on my exam so I wouldn’t recommend studying these topics if they aren’t directly relevant to your research. However, it did give me a confidence boost and I had been intending to review linear algebra for a while anyway.\n\n\nDuring the exam\nI had already given several talks about my research at conferences and seminars by this point so I wasn’t really nervous about presenting, but I was extremely nervous for the subsequent questioning. I prepared over 70 slides for the exam. About 20 of these slides were the main presentation, and the remaining 50 were supplemental slides that I could refer to if asked. I found it helpful to organize the supplemental slides by topic, so that I could easily find the slide I needed during the exam.\nThe questions I received from my committee members were all related to my research. The questions spanned a wide variety of topics, from genomics (“Why do we log-transform counts data in scRNA-seq analyses?”), GLMs (“What is the relationship between a Poisson GLM and a multinomial GLM?”), machine learning (“What is cross-validation and what are some disadvantages?”), neuroscience (“Why do we care about the different layers in the cortex?”), and public health (“What’s the difference between race and ancestry?”). I had the most difficulty answering the public health questions because I hadn’t spent a lot of time thinking about the downstream applications of my research. For anyone working on projects that are more discovery-oriented and less translational, I would recommend giving some thought to questions in this vein.\n\n\nAfter the exam\nAfter I had answered all the questions, my committee asked me to wait outside the examination room while they deliberate. I was then invited back into the room and notified that I had passed the exam. Each of my committee members gave me feedback on my presentation and my responses to their questions, and congratulated me on my progress thus far.\n\n\nClosing thoughts\nA common piece of advice (or perhaps consolation) that I heard often leading up to the exam is something along the lines of “You don’t need to stress, you know much more than you think you do!”. While I appreciate the sentiment and the goodwill behind these words, I found out while studying that sometimes you know much less than you think you do. In my honest opinion, you really do need to take the exam seriously and dedicate a substantial amount of time to studying, if not for the knowledge then at least for the confidence boost. Aside from the exam itself, I realized there were major gaps in my knowledge of the literature that I am grateful I filled while studying for the exam. Now that I am more than a month out from my exam, I find that the things I learned in preparation have been useful for my research, and I am glad to have invested the time to learn them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoffee\n\n\n\nIf you found this blog post helpful and would like to support my work, feel free to buy me a coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n“My Preliminary Oral Exam.” 2020. https://blog.albertkuo.me/post/my-preliminary-oral-exam/.\n\n\n“Preliminary Oral Exam.” 2023. https://kinnaryshah.github.io/posts/2023-12-15-oral-exam/."

    "text": "Cooking has been my main hobby throughout graduate school due to how practical and economical it is. But aside from these reasons, the biggest draw to cooking for me has always been the experience of performing physical tasks with my own hands and being able to arrive at a finished product in a relatively short time. As a graduate student in biostatistics, I find that much of my daily work takes place in my head and can feel disconnected from the physical world. The work itself can feel uncertain and unresolved, without clear steps to take. This is not necessarily a flaw of doing research, as the dual of this opacity is having near complete intellectual freedom, but it can at times be overwhelming. Cooking has always provided me with a respite from such feelings because recipes are self-contained and have discrete steps outlined.\nI have been cooking relatively intensely at home since I moved out of university housing in undergrad and needed a way to feed myself. However, the experience gained from home cooking is pretty limited as many technical skills are only improved through repetition, and it just doesn’t make sense for me to julienne 20 carrots for one meal. For this reason, I wanted to experience working in a restaurant kitchen by doing a stage. The word stage comes from the French noun stagiaire, which is a trainee or apprentice. In the culinary world, a stage is when candidates interested in a particular kitchen will work there for free for a short period of time in hopes of gaining a permanent position or just to learn the techniques employed there.\n\n\n\nA mushroom risotto I made at home. Back in undergrad, this is something I would make for my friends after a night out.\n\n\nI have dined several times at a local upscale seafood restaurant over the past few years and was impressed with the quality of the ingredients and the consistency of the food each time. On a whim, I sent an email to the owner of the restaurant and asked if I could come in for a stage and surprisingly got a positive response. I was asked to come in at 3pm on a Saturday to help with dinner service and the prep preceding it.\nWhen I showed up with my non-slip kitchen clogs (purchased just for this occasion) and my chef’s knife wrapped in a towel, I expected to be relegated to chopping stock vegetables in some back corner. I had read everything I could find on the internet about stages and knew that it was unlikely for me to touch any food that would be directly served to customers. However, I was immediately thrown into chopping vegetables for salad and at 5pm when the restaurant opened for dinner service, I was shown how to prepare appetizers like ceviche, escargot, and octopus. After one demonstration of each dish, I was expected to assist the other chefs with these dishes. As service ramped up, I was amazed by the efficiency and collaborative environment of the kitchen. It was a stressful situation because of the volume of orders but the employees were committed to completing their dishes with integrity as no level of detail was sacrificed at any point. The executive chef himself was cranking out orders along with the staff, fist bumping his employees for a job well done, and intermittently serving me samples of menu items. I was impressed by the lack of hierarchy and how large of a role teamwork played in making things run smoothly. For example, the employees were able to anticipate each others needs without verbal communication. If an order for octopus was placed, the employee responsible for plating the octopus would be preparing their station to do so, but someone else who was closer to the tools would be passing them what they need. This wasn’t something anyone had to ask for, it was just baked into the dynamics of the kitchen. This level of chemistry was achieved by not only considering what you need to do your own job well, but actively thinking about what others are doing and how you can make their lives easier too.\nI was enthralled by this experience and invited back for a second shift by the executive chef. This time, I came in on a weeknight and was able to learn a lot more as things were slower. I was shown how they make their homemade ricotta and chatted with the executive chef about how he was able to build such an efficient team. At the end of the night, the chef asked me to pick some dishes off of the menu that he and his employees then cooked for me. I was sent home with crab cakes, swordfish, ceviche, crab soup, and calamari, not to mention various desserts and a whole quart of their homemade ice cream. This act of generosity stuck with me for days as they had welcomed me into their kitchen despite my lack of culinary experience, trained me kindly and patiently even though I kept getting in the way and caused lots of trouble, and yet they felt I deserved to get something tangible out of it on top of all the time and effort they had already given me.\n\n\n\nThe bag I packed to bring to my second stage. I baked two loaves of banana bread for the staff to share as a way to thank them for all their help. My chef’s knife is wrapped in a towel and the sharpie was useful for labelling prep containers.\n\n\nBeing a stage in the kitchen was terrifying to me because I was putting myself in a situation where I would be starting from scratch and would be objectively bad at many of the required skills. Feeling inadequate and incompetent for 8 hours at a time is not an enjoyable experience, but it is an indicator that you are learning a great deal. It was also a good exercise in humility for us perfectionists as you learn that you can’t be good at everything, which is a valuable reminder in both research and real life. The life of a PhD student or any academic can sometimes feel lonely and peeking into a completely different industry was a reminder that leaning on others, and more importantly, allowing others to lean on you is what makes a team productive."

    "text": "The distribution of p-values is an important part of hypothesis testing. In the field of genomics, we commonly assess the distribution of p-values when performing differential expression analyses in order to assess whether the data was modeled correctly. Under the null hypothesis, we expect to see a uniform distribution of p-values, and deviations from this would suggest model misspecification.\nWhy is the distribution of p-values expected to be uniform under the null? Intuitively, this is clear, as under the null hypothesis there is no real effect so all values are equally likely to be observed. We can also verify this claim mathematically.\nFirst, let’s consider the test statistic we get from hypothesis testing \\(T\\), where \\(T\\) is a continuous random variable. We can then define \\(U = F_T(T)\\), where \\(F_T\\) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of \\(T\\). Assuming that there exists \\(u \\in [0,1]\\) such that \\(u=F_T^{-1}(T)\\), we can show that\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nF_U(u) &= P_U(U \\leq u) \\\\\n        &= P_U(F_T(T) \\leq u) \\\\\n        &= P_T(T \\leq F_T^{-1}(u)) \\\\\n        &= F_T(F_T^{-1}(u)) \\\\\n        &= u.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis shows that \\(U=F_T(T)\\) is uniformly distributed1. Knowing that the CDF of test statistics are uniformly distributed, we can use a similar proof to show the same for the associated p-values.\nConsider the random variable \\(V\\) representing the p-values. For the one-sided hypothesis test, the p-value is defined as \\(P(T &gt; t_{obs} | H_0)\\) where \\(H_0\\) denotes the null hypothesis. We can rewrite the p-value in terms of the CDF of \\(T\\) because \\(P(T &gt; t_{obs} | H_0) = 1 - F_T(t_{obs}) = 1 - U\\). Then,\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nF_V(v) &= P_V(V \\leq v)\\\\\n      &= P_U(1 - U \\leq v)\\\\\n      &= P_U(U \\geq 1-v)\\\\\n      &= 1-P_U(1-v)\\\\\n      &= 1-(1-v)\\\\\n      &= v,\n\\end{align}\n\\] which shows that \\(V\\) also follows a uniform distribution. Thus, p-values are uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Wikipedia. Probability integral transform — Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. (2025)."
