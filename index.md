I'm a first-year Biostatistics PhD student at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I'm interested in developing statistical methods for the analysis of single cell and spatial transcriptomics data.

In undergrad, I studied  [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology](https://bcb.csb.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. There, I worked on  evaluating and predicting scRNA-seq clustering pipeline performance under the supervision of  [Kieran Campbell](https://www.camlab.ca/). 

In July 2022, I presented the above work at [BioC2022](https://bioc2022.bioconductor.org/). The recording can be found [here](https://youtu.be/AkElObGncWE).
