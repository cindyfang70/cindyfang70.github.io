## Hi, I'm Cindy!

I'm a fourth-year undergrad studying Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the University of Toronto. I'm interested in developing computational/statistical methods for single-cell data analysis.

Currently, I'm completing my fourth-year project course with [Dr. Kieran Campbell](https://www.camlab.ca/). My project involves evaluating and predicting scRNA-seq clustering pipeline performance.

In the fall, I will be starting my PhD in Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
